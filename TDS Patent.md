Developing a novel system for ultrasonic testing of recovery boiler tubes involves both hardware and software components, each of which may be eligible for patent protection. To proceed effectively, consider the following steps:

**1. Conduct a Prior Art Search**

Begin by investigating existing patents and publications to determine if similar systems have already been patented. This process, known as a prior art search, helps assess the novelty of your invention. For instance, patents like "Studded boiler tube wall and method of measuring corrosion thereon" citeturn0search0 and "Guided acoustic wave inspection system" citeturn0search2 relate to ultrasonic testing methods for boiler tubes. While these may not be identical to your design, analyzing them can provide insights into existing technologies and help you identify unique aspects of your system.

**2. Determine Patent Eligibility**

In the United States, to be patentable, an invention must be novel, non-obvious, and useful. Your system's combination of a custom-designed ultrasonic PCB board and proprietary software could meet these criteria if it offers a technical solution to a technical problem. It's important to note that while abstract ideas and mathematical algorithms are not patentable, software that provides a specific technical improvement or application may be eligible. citeturn0search3

**3. Prepare a Thorough Disclosure**

Document your invention comprehensively, detailing its operation, components, methods of use, and desired outcomes. Include drawings, flowcharts, or wireframes to illustrate the system's functionality. This detailed disclosure will be crucial for your patent application. citeturn0search1

**4. Consult a Patent Attorney**

Engaging with a patent attorney can provide valuable guidance throughout the application process. They can assist in drafting your application to ensure it meets all legal requirements and effectively protects your invention. They can also help navigate the complexities of patent law, particularly concerning the patentability of software-related inventions. citeturn0search7

**5. File a Patent Application**

Once your application is prepared, submit it to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The application will undergo examination to assess its compliance with patentability requirements. Be prepared for an iterative process, as the patent office may raise objections or request clarifications, to which you can respond with amendments or arguments. citeturn0search26

By following these steps, you can work towards securing patent protection for your ultrasonic testing system, safeguarding your innovation in both its hardware and software components.
