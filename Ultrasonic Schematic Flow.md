### **4. TC6320 and TC2320 High-Voltage Pulsers**
- **TC6320**:
  - A high-voltage pulse generator IC designed to drive ultrasonic transducers.
  - Handles the **positive high-voltage output** (e.g., +100V) for the transducer.
- **TC2320**:
  - Complements the TC6320 by handling the **negative high-voltage output** (e.g., -100V).
- **Capacitors**:
  - Decoupling capacitors (e.g., 0.47 µF, 10 nF) ensure stable high-voltage operation.
  - Coupling capacitors (e.g., 1 µF) pass the high-frequency pulse signal to the transducer.

### **5. Ultrasonic Transducer Interface (XDCR)**
- **Transducer (XDCR)**: Converts electrical pulses into ultrasonic waves.
- **Connections**:
  - **HVout**: High-voltage output signal from the TC6320 and TC2320.

### **Signal Flow Explanation**
1. **Oscillator Initialization**:
   - The 40 MHz oscillator generates a stable clock signal.
   - This clock drives the CPLD to generate waveform signals.

2. **Waveform Generation**:
   - The CPLD produces a waveform based on the inputs (e.g., frequency selection and phase enable).
   - The waveform signals (INA, INB, INC, IND) are sent to the MD1812/13 buffer.

3. **Buffering**:
   - The MD1812/13 buffers the logic-level signals to ensure high-speed transitions and compatibility with the high-voltage pulsers.

4. **Pulse Generation**:
   - The buffered signals drive the TC6320 and TC2320, generating high-voltage pulses.
   - The positive and negative high-voltage outputs combine to produce the desired pulse waveform.

5. **Transducer Excitation**:
   - The high-voltage pulses drive the transducer (XDCR), which generates ultrasonic waves.
   - The transducer emits these waves into the material for measurement or imaging.

6. **Signal Tuning**:
   - The jumper (JP) and load components (CL, RL) adjust the electrical characteristics to match the transducer's impedance.
