1. **Pulse Generation**:
   - **TC6320** or equivalent high-voltage pulse generator IC.
    N-Channel and P-Channel Enhancement-Mode MOSFET Pair
    General Description
        The TC6320 consists of high-voltage, low-threshold
        N-channel and P-channel MOSFETs in 8-lead SOIC
        and DFN packages. Both MOSFETs have integrated
        gate-to-source resistors and gate-to-source Zener
        diode clamps which are desired for high-voltage pulser
        applications. It is a complimentary, high-speed,
        high-voltage, gate-clamped N-channel and P-channel
        MOSFET pair, which utilizes an advanced vertical
        DMOS structure and a well-proven silicon gate
        manufacturing process. This combination produces a
        device with the power handling capabilities of bipolar
        transistors and with the high input impedance and
        positive temperature coefficient inherent in MOS
        devices. Characteristic of all MOS structures, this
        device is free from thermal runaway and thermally
        induced secondary breakdown.
        Microchip’s vertical DMOS FETs are ideally suited to a
        wide range of switching and amplifying applications
        where very low threshold voltage, high breakdown
        voltage, high input impedance, low input capacitance
        and fast switching speeds are desired.

   - **MOSFET** (e.g., IRF540N) for driving the ultrasonic transducer.
   - A capacitor (200V-rated) for high-voltage pulse shaping.
   
2. **Transducer Connection**:
   - A matching transformer (e.g., Mini-Circuits T1-6T-KK81) to match impedance between the pulser circuit and the ultrasonic transducer.

3. **Signal Reception**:
   - **AD8429 Instrumentation Amplifier** for amplifying the weak echo signals.
   - A bandpass filter centered around 5 MHz to reduce noise.
   - **Schottky Diode** (e.g., 1N5711) to protect the amplifier input.

4. **Signal Processing**:
   - Output is fed to the **ADC** of the Arduino or Raspberry Pi for digitization.
