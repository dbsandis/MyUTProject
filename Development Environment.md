### **Additional Tools and Components for Prototyping**
To test and develop the ultrasonic thickness measurement board, you'll need the following:

#### **Prototyping Essentials**
1. **Solderless Breadboard**:
   - **Why**: Ideal for quickly prototyping circuits before PCB design.
   - **Recommended**: A 400–830 tie-point breadboard.
2. **Jumper Wires**:
   - **Why**: Connect the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins to the breadboard components.
   - **Recommended**: Male-to-male and male-to-female jumper wires.

#### **Testing Components**
1. **Oscilloscope**:
   - **Why**: Debug pulse signals and waveform integrity.
   - **Recommended**: Rigol DS1054Z or a USB oscilloscope like Digilent Analog Discovery 2.
2. **Multimeter**:
   - **Why**: Measure voltage, resistance, and continuity.
   - **Recommended**: Fluke 117 or a budget-friendly option like AstroAI Digital Multimeter.

#### **Additional Components**
1. **ADS1115 ADC Module**:
   - **Why**: High-resolution ADC for sampling echo signals.
   - **Where to Buy**: Amazon, Adafruit, or Digi-Key.
2. **Resistors and Capacitors Kit**:
   - **Why**: Prototyping requires a variety of passive components.
   - **Recommended**: Get a kit with values commonly used (10 Ω to 1 MΩ for resistors, 1 nF to 10 µF for capacitors).
3. **Ultrasonic Transducer**:
   - **Why**: Core component for testing the pulser circuit.
   - **Recommended**: Olympus V260-S (5 MHz) or similar.

#### **Tools**
1. **Soldering Iron Kit**:
   - **Why**: For assembling circuits on a protoboard or final PCB.
   - **Recommended**: Hakko FX-888D or Weller WE1010NA.
2. **Breadboard Power Supply**:
   - **Why**: Powers the breadboard independently.
   - **Recommended**: A breadboard power supply module with 3.3V and 5V output options.

### **Steps to Start Testing**
1. **Set Up the Raspberry Pi**:
   - Install Raspberry Pi OS on the included microSD card.
   - Connect the GPIO breakout board to the breadboard.

2. **Assemble the Circuit**:
   - Use the schematic provided earlier to replicate the pulser, amplifier, and filter sections on the breadboard.

3. **Program the Raspberry Pi**:
   - Write a Python program using libraries like `RPi.GPIO` or `pigpio` for pulse generation and signal acquisition.

4. **Test the Circuit**:
   - Verify the pulse signals and echo response using an oscilloscope.
   - Debug and optimize the circuit as needed.

5. **Prototype PCB Design**:
   - Once the breadboard circuit is tested, use tools like KiCad or EasyEDA to design a PCB for a Raspberry Pi HAT.
